# YouTube comment cleaner

## What is this?

Most regular users of YouTube would concede that the comments section is a disaster, and can at times be highly toxic.

The scripts included herein attempt to remove some of the most vitriolic of the bunch, with the ability to adjust the blacklisted words as desired.

## Installation

Grab the contents of the User Script, and paste it into a new User Script in your preferred User Script browser extension, or import the **.js** file into said manager.

## Usage

1. Once added to your User Script manager, you're done.
2. Refresh the page to see comments hidden the match the word list.

## Notes
You can add or remove words to the list without breaking the script, as long as you enter them in the comma-separated format the existing blacklisted are already in.
